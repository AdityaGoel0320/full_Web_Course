# Contributing Guidelines

## Guidelines :
- The code must be of good quality with enough documentation within the resource file. Please refer `CONTRIBUTING.md` to know more about documentation process and its advantages.
- Different programming languages and software related cheatsheet snippets can be added to this repository.
- Add a container in the main page and then link that content box to the start file and folder referring that particular entity (such as Python, Java etc..)
- Any mistakes found ? Feel free to raise an issue! We are happy to rectify and to work on it.
- Avoid simple commits and try to contribute more set of cheatsheet code snippets in those respective domains.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Ensure that you describe your pull request.

## Why is program documentation important?
- The main purpose of program documentation is to describe the design of your program.
- The documentation also provides the framework in which to place the code.
- As coding progresses, the code is inserted into the framework already created by the program documentation.
- Documentation is important to tell other programmers what the program does and how it works.
- Documentation helps others on the team to understand your work.
- Maintenance and debugging are needed sooner or later for most programs and these are frequently done by someone other than the original programmer.
- Documentation can help the programmer who is making the modifications understand your code.
- Documenting your program during development helps you to maintain your sanity.

## When should program documentation be done?

- When designing your program, you must spend time thinking about how to structure your program, what modules are needed, and the algorithms and processes you will use in the modules.
- This thinking must be done before you start coding, or you will find yourself wasting time writing useless code that is full of errors.
- It is very important to record this creative process so that the programmers that follow you do not duplicate work that you have already done.
- Before writing the code, you should write the documentation to describe the design of each component of your program.
- Writing documentation for the modules before writing the code helps you define exactly what each module should do and how it will interact with other modules.
- Focusing on the design and the steps needed to solve the problem can help prevent errors in the completed program.

## What information should be in the program documentation?
For an individual module, it is important to record <br>
- who has written the module, 
- when the module was written or modified,
- why the module was written or modified, 
- how the module interacts with other modules,
- acknowledge outside sources from which datas are taken.

## For cheatsheets, it is important to record 
- [ ] detailing of each code snippet, 
- [ ] organized listing of all code snippets,
- [ ] maintaining relatable images and other resources within the codes,
- [ ] must be of simple and readable language for documenting.
